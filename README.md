# Student Performance Prediction 

## Mission
This project is dedicated to improving education in The Gambia through modern technology, leveraging Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to provide data-driven insights that enhance learning strategies. By analyzing key academic performance factors, this initiative aims to equip students, educators, and policymakers with tools to optimize study habits, improve teaching methods, and drive educational success through intelligent systems and predictive analytics.

## Dataset Description
The dataset explores the relationship between study habits, sleep patterns, extracurricular activities, and prior academic achievements with students' performance indices. This information helps in identifying key factors that contribute to success in academics, forming a strong foundation for personalized learning recommendations.

## Dataset Characteristics
The dataset contains the following variables:
- **Hours Studied** - Time spent studying before an exam.
- **Previous Scores** - Past academic performance as an indicator of progress.
- **Extracurricular Activities** - Whether the student is engaged in activities outside academics.
- **Sleep Hours** - Amount of sleep before an exam.
- **Sample Question Papers Practiced** - The number of practice papers solved before an exam.
- **Performance Index** - The final outcome representing academic success.

## Data Richness
- **Volume**: The dataset contains sufficient records of 10000 entries(Rows) with 6 Columns to analyze academic performance trends.
- **Variety**: It captures diverse factors, including behavioral and academic influences, ensuring a holistic view of student performance.

## Visualizations
### 1. Correlation Heatmap
The **heatmap** below illustrates how each feature contributes to or correlates with the target variable, Performance Index:

- **Previous Scores** has the highest correlation value of **0.92**, indicating that prior academic performance is the strongest predictor of future performance. The positive correlation suggests that higher previous scores generally lead to higher performance indices.

- **Hours Studied** follows with a correlation of **0.37**, showing that increased study hours are associated with improved academic outcomes, though not as strongly as previous scores.

- **Extracurricular Activities** has the lowest correlation value of **0.02**. While its direct impact on the performance index is minimal, it still plays a role in a student's overall academic experience and well-being.
