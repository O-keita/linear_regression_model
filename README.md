# Student Performance Prediction 

## Mission
This project is dedicated to improving education in The Gambia through modern technology, leveraging Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to provide data-driven insights that enhance learning strategies. By analyzing key academic performance factors, this initiative aims to equip students, educators, and policymakers with tools to optimize study habits, improve teaching methods, and drive educational success through intelligent systems and predictive analytics.

## Dataset Description
The dataset explores the relationship between study habits, sleep patterns, extracurricular activities, and prior academic achievements with students' performance indices. This information helps in identifying key factors that contribute to success in academics, forming a strong foundation for personalized learning recommendations.

### Source
If sourced from Kaggle, the dataset should be referenced accordingly. Otherwise, it is an educational dataset created for research and learning purposes.

## Use Case
Unlike generic datasets, this dataset is specifically designed for academic performance prediction, helping students personalize their learning plans by understanding how different factors impact their results. It enables educational institutions to enhance personalized learning recommendations and intervention strategies.

## Dataset Characteristics
The dataset contains the following variables:
- **Hours Studied** - Time spent studying before an exam.
- **Previous Scores** - Past academic performance as an indicator of progress.
- **Extracurricular Activities** - Whether the student is engaged in activities outside academics.
- **Sleep Hours** - Amount of sleep before an exam.
- **Sample Question Papers Practiced** - The number of practice papers solved before an exam.
- **Performance Index** - The final outcome representing academic success.

## Data Richness
- **Volume**: The dataset contains sufficient records to analyze academic performance trends.
- **Variety**: It captures diverse factors, including behavioral and academic influences, ensuring a holistic view of student performance.

## Visualizations
### 1. Correlation Heatmap
A heatmap will visualize the correlation between different features to understand which variables have the strongest impact on performance.

### 2. Distribution Plots
Histograms or scatterplots will showcase the distribution of study hours, sleep patterns, and past scores, highlighting trends that affect performance.

## Potential Applications
- Personalized learning recommendations based on study patterns.
- Insights for educators to improve curriculum effectiveness.
- Research on the balance between extracurricular activities and academic success.
- Development of AI-driven tutoring systems to support students.
- Data-driven policymaking for educational reforms in The Gambia.

By leveraging this dataset, this project aims to refine educational strategies and improve student outcomes through data-driven insights and technological advancements.
